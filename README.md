# myChess project:

A fully functional C++ chess engine, implements the core rules of chess, including move validation, capturing, and checkmate. Itâ€™s designed with modularity and extensibility in mind, featuring a clean, OOP structure that makes it easy to add new features. like AI opponents, castling, and en passant. The project also includes unit tests to ensure reliability and correctness.




## Current Features:
**1. Core Chess Logic:** Full implementation of piece movement and game rules.

**2. Game Board Display:** A text-based board representation, showing the position of each piece.

**3. Undo/Redo Functionality:** Players can undo and redo moves with a stack-based history using the Memento pattern.

**4. Observer Pattern for Captured Pieces:** Tracks and displays captured pieces via an observer system.

**5. Unit Tests:** Integrated unit tests to verify the correctness of piece movement, captures, and other game mechanics.




## Upcoming Features:

**1. Castling and En Passant:** Complete the chess rules by adding these special moves.

**2. AI Opponent:** Play against a basic AI that suggests and makes moves.

**3. Captured Pieces Tracking:** A feature to display and manage captured pieces for both players.
